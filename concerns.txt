-For User logs view we need to make sure we are  actually comparing the post id and user_blogs id (these should be the same) 
so that the users blogs are paginated correctly

-Verify that we are sending all necessary data to the templates. If the template needs access to the user data it should be sent in
the render

- HTMl for feed we are attempting to access posts.username, this should work bc of the relationship set up but it 
may not we'll have to check
